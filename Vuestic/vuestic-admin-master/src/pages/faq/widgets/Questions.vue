              A Secure Key is an extra layer of security that helps look after you and your money by generating a
              unique, single use security code every time you log on or authorise a payment. There are two types of
              Secure Key - a Digital version that works as part of the Mobile Banking App - perfect if you have a
              smartphone or tablet. Or, you can use a Physical version that is a little key ring that looks like a mini
              calculator.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              We recommend setting up a Digital Secure Key. Itâ€™s built into the first direct Banking App, and if you
              have the right type of smartphone you can use your fingerprint or face recognition to seamlessly log on or
              authorise payments.

        <VaCollapse header="How do I report fraud?">
          <article class="max-w-3xl text-sm">
            <p class="mb-3">
              Reporting fraud is a serious matter, and it's important to take appropriate steps to address and prevent
              fraudulent activities. The specific process for reporting fraud may vary based on your location and the
              nature of the fraud, but here's a general guide:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside leading-6 ml-4 mb-4">
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Report to Relevant Authorities:</span> Depending on the nature of the fraud,
                you may need to report to other relevant authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission
                (SEC) for investment-related fraud or the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for scams and deceptive
                practices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Document All Details:</span> Make sure to document all the relevant details
                about the fraud, including dates, times, names of individuals involved (if known), financial
                transactions, and any communication related to the fraud.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Report to Internet Crime Organizations:</span> If the fraud involves online
                activities, consider reporting to organizations that deal with internet crimes, such as the Internet
                Crime Complaint Center (IC3). IC3 is a partnership between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime
                Center.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Remember to act promptly and follow the specific reporting procedures relevant to your location and the
              type of fraud you've encountered. Taking swift action can help mitigate potential damage and prevent
              further fraudulent activities.
